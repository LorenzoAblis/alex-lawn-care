          At MP Green Teens, we have been doing snow removal for the past 4
          years. We started as kids with only shovels and worked our way up to
          snowblowers and powerful snow augers! Please text or call us for a
          quote. We can do sidewalks, steps, decks, driveways, small awnings,
          and even clean off your car for you. We can salt, either with regular
          rock salt or pet safe ice melt to help with those icy steps,
          sidewalks, and walkways. We offer super reasonable prices starting at
          $15 for small areas, such as condos/townhouses, with the average
          mid-size house (driveway, steps, walkways) at around $30 - $40. Also,
          if it snows on consecutive days, you'll receive a 50% discount on
          additional days because we understand the frustration of paying for a
          clean-up, only to have it snow again the next day!
